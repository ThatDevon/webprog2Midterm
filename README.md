# Pongratz Midterm
An angular application which showcases league of legends champions.

## Notes
I believe for this since I use the local database, you have to have mongo shard running already to run the application. If you don't, the homepage will never load champions.
In development I dabbled with Atlas, but I believe I would have to whitelist IP's for that data to work, or run it on a proper server.

## Running the app
To run this program, open terminal and run the standard 'ng serve', and then open another terminal window and run 'npm run start:server'.
